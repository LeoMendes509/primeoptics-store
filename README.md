This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Technologies Used

### Next.js 15
- React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- Provides server-side rendering, static generation, and modern routing using the App Router.
- Improves SEO, performance, and developer experience.

### React
- Core UI library used to build modular and reusable components.
- Enables efficient rendering and a powerful component-based structure.

### TypeScript
- Superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing.
- Improves reliability, reduces runtime errors, and enhances IDE support.

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and consistent interfaces.
- Speeds up styling with predefined utility classes.

- Product catalog and categories
- Product detail pages
- API integrations
- Authentication and user management
- Shopping cart and checkout flow
- Admin dashboard for product and inventory control

---

## Current Structure
The project includes:

- Organized folder structure using the Next.js App Router
- `src/` directory for all application code
- Preconfigured TypeScript and ESLint setup
- Tailwind CSS integrated with global styles
